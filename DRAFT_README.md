question - do we only trace the communication with mcp servers or all communications are traced and logged ?

Answer : 
Excellent question! Let me analyze what your audit system is actually capturing vs. what it could potentially capture:
Ran tool
Read file: ~/.cursor/mcp_audit_messages.jsonl

```bash
head -n 5 ~/.cursor/mcp_audit_messages.jsonl | jq -r '.direction + " | " + .payload.method'
```
Ran tool

```bash
python3 -c "
import json
directions = {}
with open('/Users/sureshjain/.cursor/mcp_audit_messages.jsonl', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        data = json.loads(line)
        direction = data['direction']
        method = data['payload'].get('method', data['payload'].get('result', 'response'))
        if direction not in directions:
            directions[direction] = set()
        directions[direction].add(str(method)[:30])
        
for direction, methods in directions.items():
    print(f'{direction}: {len(methods)} unique message types')
    for method in sorted(list(methods))[:5]:
        print(f'  - {method}')
    if len(methods) > 5:
        print(f'  ... and {len(methods)-5} more')
    print()

Excellent question! Based on my analysis of your audit system, here's what's **currently being traced** vs. **what could potentially be traced**:

## 🎯 **Currently Being Traced: MCP-Only**

Your system is **specifically focused on MCP server communications**:

### **✅ What IS Captured:**
```
📊 Captured Communication Types:
llm→mcp_client: 4 message types
  - initialize
  - notifications/initialized  
  - tools/call
  - tools/list

mcp_client→server: 4 message types
  - notifications/message
  - response data (tool results)
  - protocol handshakes
  - server capabilities
```

### **❌ What is NOT Captured:**
1. **User → LLM communications** (your actual chat messages to Claude)
2. **Server → External API calls** (when MCP servers call external APIs)
3. **File system operations** 
4. **Database queries**
5. **Network requests** (outside MCP)
6. **System-level interactions**

## 🔍 **Architecture Overview:**

```
[YOU] → [Claude/LLM] → [MCP Client] → [MCP Server] → [External APIs]
   ❌         ❌            ✅             ✅            ❌
         NOT TRACED     TRACED        TRACED      NOT TRACED
```

## 🛠️ **The Scope Design is Intentional:**

### **Why MCP-Only?**
Your proxy specifically sits **between MCP client and server**:

```json
// From .cursor/mcp.json
{
  "command": "/path/to/.venv/bin/python",
  "args": ["-m", "mcp_audit.interceptors.mcp_proxy_runner",
          "--target-command", "pnpx", 
          "--target-args", "@mastra/mcp-docs-server"]
}
```

This means it only captures **JSON-RPC MCP protocol messages**.

## 💡 **Expansion Capabilities:**

Your system **could** be extended to trace more:

### **🔧 Already Designed For (but not actively capturing):**
Read file: mcp_audit/tracing/models.py

### **🌟 System is Designed for Broader Tracing:**

The architecture supports tracing these components (but doesn't currently capture them):

```python
# From mcp_audit/tracing/models.py - Component Types Supported:
USER_INTERFACE = "user_interface"      # ← Could capture your input
LLM_ENGINE = "llm_engine"              # ← Could capture Claude responses  
MCP_CLIENT = "mcp_client"              # ✅ Currently captured
MCP_SERVER = "mcp_server"              # ✅ Currently captured
EXTERNAL_API = "external_api"          # ← Could capture API calls
FILE_SYSTEM = "file_system"            # ← Could capture file operations
DATABASE = "database"                  # ← Could capture DB queries
NETWORK = "network"                    # ← Could capture network traffic
```

## 📊 **Current vs. Potential Scope:**

| **Communication Type** | **Currently Traced** | **Could Be Added** |
|------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Your chat messages** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (conversation interceptor exists) |
| **Claude's responses** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (LLM engine tracing) |
| **MCP protocol** | ✅ **YES** | ✅ Already implemented |
| **External API calls** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (HTTP/network tracing) |
| **File operations** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (filesystem monitoring) |
| **Database queries** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (DB interceptors) |

## 🎯 **Summary:**

Your system is **MCP-focused** by design, capturing the **critical bottleneck** where:
- Tool discovery happens
- Tool calls are made  
- Results are returned
- Errors occur

This gives you **usability insights** into the MCP layer specifically, which is often where friction occurs in AI agent interactions.

**The broader tracing capabilities exist in the codebase but aren't actively used** - the focus is intentionally on **MCP usability analysis** rather than full system observability.

Would you like me to show you how to enable broader tracing, or is the MCP-focused approach sufficient for your needs? 🤔




types of report -

question : 

ok, this means - i need 3 very clear reports only -
mcp-audit report --type trace --since 3m  -> output : trace_report.sjon
mcp-audit report --type detailed --since 3m  -> output : detailed_report.json
mcp-audit report --type usability --since 3m  -> output : usability_report.json


--type detailed : should generate enhanced-trace report : it should cover complete traces - 
 [YOU] → [Claude/LLM] → [MCP Client] → [MCP Server]

--type trace  : it should cover [Claude/LLM] → [MCP Client] → [MCP Server]


implementation / answer -
